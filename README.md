# 🖥️ Operating System Learning & Experiments   

This repository is my personal journey of learning **Operating System (OS)** concepts, commands, and experiments.  
I created this repo to document my hands-on practice with OS commands, experiments, and mistakes I learned from.  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **commands/** → Linux/UNIX commands with examples and explanations.  
- **experiments/** → Step-by-step OS lab experiments (process, memory, scheduling, file system).  
- **notes/** → My reflections, mistakes, and key learnings.  

## 🚀 Why this repo?
I wanted to:  
- Strengthen my OS knowledge by practicing commands.  
- Keep my experiments and notes in one place.  
- Share my learning experience with others.
