# ðŸ“˜ Unit 1 â€“ Introduction to Operating System  

## 1.1 Overview of Operating System  
- An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an **interface between user and hardware**.  
- It manages **hardware resources** (CPU, memory, devices) and provides services to applications.  
- Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS, UNIX.  

## 1.2 Functions of an Operating System  
1. **Process Management** â€“ Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.  
2. **Memory Management** â€“ Allocates and deallocates memory to processes.  
3. **File Management** â€“ Manages files, directories, and access permissions.  
4. **I/O Management** â€“ Controls input/output devices.  
5. **Security & Protection** â€“ Prevents unauthorized access.  
6. **Error Detection** â€“ Detects and responds to errors in the system.  

## 1.3 Types of Operating Systems  
- **Batch OS** â€“ Jobs are processed in batches without user interaction.  
- **Time Sharing OS** â€“ Multiple users share CPU time (e.g., UNIX).  
- **Real-Time OS** â€“ Provides quick response to events (used in robotics, aviation).  
- **Distributed OS** â€“ Controls multiple computers as a single system.  
- **Network OS** â€“ Manages networking and data sharing across systems.  
- **Mobile OS** â€“ For smartphones (Android, iOS).  

## 1.4 Command-Line vs GUI Based OS  
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** User types commands (e.g., DOS, UNIX shell).  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** User interacts with windows, icons, and menus (e.g., Windows, macOS).  

## 1.5 OS Components  
1. **Process Management** â€“ CPU scheduling, process synchronization.  
2. **Main Memory Management** â€“ Allocation, swapping, paging, segmentation.  
3. **File Management** â€“ File operations, directories, storage.  
4. **I/O System Management** â€“ Buffering, caching, device drivers.  
5. **Secondary Storage Management** â€“ Disk scheduling, free space management.  
6. **Security System** â€“ Protection of data and resources.
